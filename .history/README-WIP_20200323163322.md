# Bainesface News API

#### Welcome to this Reddit-style news API database!

The hosted version can be accessed [here](https://bainesface-app.herokuapp.com/api).

The front end code can be found [here]()

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js version 13.10.1
- PostgreSQL version 11.5

### **Installation**

Once the above are installed follow these steps.

1. Clone the following repository

> https://github.com/bainesface/backend_news.git

2. Navigate into the repository

> cd backend_news

3. Install the required dependencies

> npm i

4. If you want to run the test suite you will need to install mocha and chai as developer dependencies

> npm i mocha chai

5. A 'knex.js' file will need to be made at the root of the directory. If not using MacOS, you will need to create a username and password for PostgreSQL.

```javascript
const { DB_URL } = process.env;
const ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';

const baseConfig = {
  client: 'pg',
  migrations: {
    directory: './db/migrations'
  },
  seeds: {
    directory: './db/seeds'
  }
};

const customConfig = {
  development: {
    connection: {
      database: 'nc_news'
      //user: "your_psql_username",
      //password: "your_psql_password"
    }
  },
  test: {
    connection: {
      database: 'nc_news_test'
      //user: "your_psql_username",
      //password: "your_psql_password"
    }
  },
  production: { connection: `${DB_URL}?ssl=true` }
};

module.exports = { ...customConfig[ENV], ...baseConfig };
```

6. Now you can seed the local database

> npm run setup-dbs
>
> npm run seed-dev

## **Testing**

There are two methods for testing.

1. The utility functions manipulating data to be added to the database.

> npm run test-utils

2. The server app itself.

> npm t
